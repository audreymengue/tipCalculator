# Tip Calculator

## Description: 

  Let's imagine you go to a restaurant and you want to give a tip because of the great service but then you don't want to overdo it. The tip calculator will help you give within a range of 15%, 20%, 50% or even customized. In order to practice my vanilla JavaScript skills, I chose to build this little project. It will help me understand:
  - Events and callbacks
  - Event object
  - Switch statement
  - Variables and arithmetics with JavaScript
  - Function Calls

## Technologies used

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Challenges faced
 - After performing an operatio, the bill as well as the results will vanish.
